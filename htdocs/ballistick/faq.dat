Q:	How do I purchase a Lab Pass?

The one-year Lab Pass is the best deal.

Gameplay
--------

Q:	Where did the old Stick Arena go?
A:	All of the gameplay and features of Stick Arena that you love are in this new Ballistick Expansion, the old Stick Arena has been replaced. You can even enjoy additional free features that enhance the classic Stick Arena experience.


Q:	How do I control my character?
A:	Movement is controlled with the directional keys on the keyboard, or the WASD keys. Aiming and firing is controlled with the mouse, by pointing and clicking in the direction you want to fire. Hold down the mouse button to fire continuously.


Q:	Why does my character keep getting killed?
A:	Stick Arena is a competitive game with bit of a learning curve, and new players can be overwhelmed at times by more experienced players. Keep practicing! You'll find that your skills improve over time.


Q:	The game is running slowly, is there any thing I can do to improve performance?
A:	You can alleviate this issue by opening the options panel from the icon in the lower left (during game play) and setting the detail option to 'low' and particles to 'off'. In most cases, players located outside in the Eastern Hemisphere will experience better gameplay by switching to the European Server, using the dropdown box in the upper right corner of the lobby.

Due to a quirk with the flash player, you can also adversely affect performance during gameplay by rapidly clicking to fire your weapon. We recommend holding down the fire button in those situations, which will cause your weapon to fire as rapidly as it is able.


Q:	Why does my character continue moving on his own?
A:	A flash bug can cause your character to continuously move, try pressing any of the movement keys on WASD, arrows or the numpad to clear this move action.


Q:	Is there any way to see detailed information about FPS (Frames Per Second) or my ping to the server?
A:	Press ~ (tilde) to toggle FPS, Aggregate Ping, and Personal Ping display. Hit ~ again to show each player's individual Ping time. Hit ~ once more to hide Ping/FPS information.


Q:	How can I play the new levels, and use all weapons?
A:	The new levels and weapons are reserved for Stick Arena players who own a Lab Pass. See this page for information on obtaining a Lab Pass.

You can also play the new maps and weapons if a player with a Lab Pass adds you to his or her VIP list. This will allow you to join a 'Lab Pass Only' game for as long as that player stays in the Arena.


Q:	Why do some players have different types of Spinners and/or Pets?
A:	Spinners and pets can be purchased on the shop page with Cred. The best Spinners and Pets require that you own a Lab Pass to purchase them. Further information about spinner and pets is available in the shop area.
