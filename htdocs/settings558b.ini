&sEditorText43=Welcome to the Stick Arena Map Editor!


New Map -- Allows you to create a new map which you can play with anyone.  You will need to purchase at least one map slot from the shop area in order to save your map.

Load Map -- Allows you to load a previously saved custom map.

&sEditorText44=Map Name -- Your map name must be at least 3 characters long and must not be offensive or inappropriate.

Map Size -- Stick Arena Maps are made up of small squares called �Tiles�. The more tiles there are, the larger the map will be (Default size is 12�9 tiles).

Map Theme -- The theme will affect the default ground tiles automatically placed on your map. It will also determine which background will be displayed during the round summary screen, after your map is played.&

&sEditorText45=Select a map from the list below to continue.  Note that you cannot load an empty map slot - return to the Map Editor Menu and select 'New Map' to use an empty map slot.&

View Tiles (Hotkey: T) -- This button will allow you to view all of the tiles available, one page at a time. Click the arrows at the top to view the other pages of tiles. Clicking on a tile will automatically put you back to your map with the paintbrush tool selected. You can then place the tile where you want it by left clicking on the map.

Eye Dropper (Hotkey: E) -- This tool will allow you to easily copy a tile. Click on the �Eye Dropper� tool then click on the tile you would like to copy. Once you have clicked on a tile, you will be automatically switched to the paintbrush tool to then place the duplicated tile on you map.

Rotate Tile (Hotkey: R) -- This tool allows you to turn a tile 90 degrees. Click the �Rotate Tile� button then click on the tile you would like to rotate. To rotate a tile 180 degrees simply click on the tile twice.

Weapons/Spawns Placement Hotkeys
----

Delete Weapon or Player Spawn (Hotkey: X) -- This tool allows you to remove any weapons or player spawns that have been placed on your map by left clicking them.

Place Player Spawn -- This tool assigns a tile on your map to be a location where players will spawn. You are limited to placing 8 player spawns per map and they must occur on a walk-able tile.

(You will need to purchase at least one map slot from the shop area to save future maps).&
&sEditorText55=Saving...&
&sEditorText56=You have chosen to save over an exising map.  If you press 'ok', your map will be saved to this slot and the existing map will be overwritten (this cannot be undone).  Additionally, votes for the existing map will be reset to zero.

Are you sure you want to save to this slot?&
&sEditorText57=You have been disconnected from the server.  This may be due to a connectivity issue, or long period of inactivity.&

&sEditorText62=Before you can save, your map must include at least one player spawn point.  Please use the spawn toolbar to add a player spawn point.&
&sEditorText63=You have no map slots to save to - you can create a new map, but you will be unable to save without purchasing a map slot from the Shop area first (Note that you cannot purchase a map slot from within the Map Editor - exit the editor and click the 'Shop' tab to purchase a map slot).&
